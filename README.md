# Modulari WebApp

A curated collection of **stand‑alone, single‑file web applications** built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no external dependencies, no build steps, 100 % offline‑ready.

Each app is self‑contained, lightweight, and easy to run locally by simply opening the `.html` file in any modern browser. The project demonstrates modular design principles applied to small‑scale utilities, mini‑tools, and interactive demos.
